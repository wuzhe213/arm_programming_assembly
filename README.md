# arm_programming_assembly
Pure assembly programming on stm32f407-discovery board

This repo created to record my learning of arm cortex-m f4.
And also hope it can help others.

I decide to use arm assembly langurage for two reasons. 
First, I think assembly it's the way to truly understand a chip
Two, I don't see anybody seriously did it. So, it's a true learning.
